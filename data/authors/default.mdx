## Ashan Eranga

Hey, I’m Ashan, a self-taught developer, writer and an open source enthusiast exploring what’s possible on the web and with software. I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as pushing myself to learn more through open source projects and share my knowledge with other developers.

## 💡 - What I’ve been up to

I've been recently focused on building React (specifically Next.js) applications, using popular tools such as Tailwind, Prisma and GraphQl and to help me bring my ideas to life.

## 😎 - Interests

I’m currently interested in building tools that help us make things developing faster and more efficient.

Also, I spend my free time playing music, reading books, and enjoying time with friends and family.
